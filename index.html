            <h2>Perfect Ugali</h2>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Maize flour</li>
                <li>Water</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Steps:</strong>Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, then gradually stir in maize flour until the mixture thickens and forms a firm dough-like consistency. Keep stirring to avoid lumps and ensure even cooking. Once it's smooth and pulls away from the sides of the pan, let it steam for a few minutes, then shape and serve hot.</p> 
            <p>Ugali is best enjoyed with vegetables, meat, or stew for a hearty, traditional Kenyan meal.</p>
